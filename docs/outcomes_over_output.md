# Outcomes over Output

From _Chapter 1: What are Outcomes?_ from the book [Outcomes over Output](https://www.senseandrespondpress.com/managing-outcomes):

"... So the product team got to work: we designed and started building an ambiguous new
trading app. When it was done, it would be unparalleled in terms of look, feel, and
function. But two years later, we still hadn't shipped anything. Leadership shuts the
program down. Despite the fantastic technical and design talent working diligently,
the program had been a failure.

What went wrong? We had just spent two years making stuff. And we picked the wrong thing
to make. Sure the design tested well, and the prototypes looked good, but rest assured,
it was the wrong stuff. It was too hard to make, there was no customer demand for it,
and we could have solved the problem by making other, simpler things.

All that stuff that looked-good-in-planning led us to work for more than two years
without delivering anything. We delivered no new capabilities to our customers, and
we delivered no value to our business. Said another way, our team generated no outcomes."

- Joshua Seiden

## What are Outcomes?

* You can manage a team by telling them what to make: that's called managing outputs.
It's a problem because features don't always deliver value.
* You can manage a team by asking them to create some high-level value, like growing
revenue. That's called managing impact. It's a problem because it's not specific enough.
* What you want is to manage with outcomes: ask teams to create a specific customer behavior
that drives business results. That allows them to find the right solution and keep them
focused on delivering value.
* For our purpose, an outcome is "a change in customer behavior the drives business
results.
* Outcomes and agility. Using outcomes to direct the work of your teams unlocks your team's
creativity. They will work to find the best solution to the problem at hand to
create the outcome you seek.
* To figure out if your outputs create the outcomes you seek, you need to test and run
experiments. MVP is just a buzzword that means "experiment."

## Using Outcomes

* Don't mistake impact - high-level aspirational goals - for outcomes. The impact is important,  but it's too big for anyone group to target.
* Use the magic questions to define outcomes: what are the human behaviors that drive
business results. How can we get people to do more of these things? How will we know we're
right?
* Remember that by "humans" we mean customers, users, employees, stakeholders, or anyone
involved in the system that we're building.
* When you're planning work, be clear about your assumptions. Be prepared to test your
assumptions by expressing work as hypotheses. Test your hypotheses continuously by working
in small iterations, experimenting, and responding to the data and feedback you collect.
* Use outcomes to track progress. Leading indicators tell you that you're going to hit
or miss your target. Lagging indicators show your goal. Build an understanding of what
behaviors _lead to_ achieving the _targets_ you seek.
* Use outcomes (not features) to plan initiatives. Ask, "what new behaviors will this
initiative create that will deliver business value? How can we deliver that value
sooner?"
* OKRs can be improved if you think of the Key Results as an outcome.

## Outcomes-based Planning

* Planning with outputs limit teams' agility and problem-solving flexibility. Increase
teams' capabilities here by planning around outcomes.
* Create outcomes-based roadmaps that list questions, themes, and outcomes instead of
features.
* One way to find outcomes is to create Customer Journey Maps. These maps help visualize
how systems work in terms of customer (and employee) behavior, and so can help you find
essential outcomes in the system.

## Outcomes for Transformation

* When considering organizational change, take a customer-centric approach with your
colleagues. What are their goals? What value can you offer to them in order to get them
to "buy" the change you are selling?
* Fram organizational change initiatives in terms of outcomes. What are the new behaviors
you want to create in the organization? What will people be doing differently when your
change program is successful?
* Changing people's behavior is hard and not easy to predict or plan on paper. Instead,
take an action-oriented approach: experiment your way forward to make progress.
