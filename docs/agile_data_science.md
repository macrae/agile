* DS stories are difficult to estimate
* Scope and requirements may change quickly
* “Deliverables” of DS sprints

* Iterate, Iterate, iterate: tables, charts, reports, predictions
* Ship intermediate output. Even failed experiments have output.
* Prototype experiments over implementing tasks
* “Integrate the tyrannical opinion of data in product management”
* Climb up and down the data-value pyramid as we work.
* Discover and pursue the critical path to a killer product.
* Get meta. Describe the process, not just the end state.

> “It turns out that there is a basic conflict in shipping analytics products, and that is the conflict between the research and the application development timeline. This conflict tends to make every analytics product a waterfall project, even those that set out to use a software engineering methodology like Scrum.”

> “Research, even applied research, is science. It involves iterative experiments, in which the learning from one experiment informs the next experiment. Science excels at discovery, but it differs from engineering in that there is no specified endpoint (see Figure 1-3).”

In data science, by contrast to software engineering, code shouldn’t always be good; it should be eventually good. This means that some technical debt up front is acceptable, so long as it is not excessive.

> “When will we ship?” is the question management wants to know the answer to in order to set expectations with the customer and coordinate sales, marketing, recruiting, and other efforts. With an Agile Data Science team, you don’t get a straight answer to that question.

To remain agile, we must embrace and adapt to these new conditions. We must adopt changes in line with lean methodologies to stay productive.
Several changes in particular make a return to agility possible:
* Choosing generalists over specialists
* Preferring small teams over large teams
* Using high-level tools and platforms: cloud computing, distributed systems, and platforms as a service (PaaS)
* Continuous and iterative sharing of intermediate work, even when that work may be incomplete

This one has a two track eng/ds system, but where the two teams have worked out how to collaborate effectively. DS uses “timeboxing” for stories instead of specific plannings.


## Notes: "Successful DS Teams are Agile and Cross-Functional

* The best data driven product companies build with small, agile teams of data scientists and engineers who are good at working together. The engineer understands the algorithm that the applied math person ends up using, because they have been discussing it as it evolves.
