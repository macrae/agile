This section is designed to be a quick reference from what we learned at the training. This is not intended as a comprehensive dive into any of these subjects.

### A Note on Terminology

The “Agile” framework comes from the early 2000s, before “Data Science” was even a term in consistent usage. Therefore, Agile refers to the “Developer” to mean typically “software developers”. However, in Agile parlance, the “Developer” is just a member of the cross-functional product-development team, and might therefore include designers, testers, engineers, QA, or whatever is needed to create the “product”.

In Data Science, the ultimate goal is still a “product” which delivers business value, and therefore we will use the term “developer” to refer to a “member of the product development team” for simplicity below.

## Agile Core Tenets

### Deliver Early, Deliver Often!
This often might mean “delivered to the product manager” rather than to the customer, but this constant early delivery does allow the product owner to evaluate whether the team is building the right thing – what the customer actually needs, not just what they think they need.

### Focus
*	“When everything is a priority, nothing is.”
*	Avoid interruptions:
    *	Maximize flow
    *	Minimize unnecessary context-switching
*	Task-switching is expensive
    *	2 projects is the optimal number for people to be working on
    *	… but communication is actually your first project. (slack, email…)
    *	Tune your WIP; more things makes us less productive.

### Responsiveness to Change
The world is constantly changing, as are our perceptions, understandings, and beliefs. Therefore, be nimble and able to change course based on new information when possible.

When things change, reorder the backlog.

### Avoid Waste
* “Do as little as possible and no less”
* e.g. In Waterfall, when you spend months writing a perfect requirements document, but then only implement 10% of the document, the other 90% is waste. Don’t bother.

#### Learning / Continuous Improvement

## Agile Disciplines
### Continuous Communication
* ... but not for developers
* As a manager, you need to welcome / invite interruptions
* But actually *regular, repeated* communication because software development is a team sport
* Information Radiators are also continuous communication

### Attention to Quality
Have a Common Definition of Done
* … as defined by the team
* A DoD that matches our work & our team
* Not acceptance tests; for every story.

### Timeboxes
* Lead to focus!
* Suggested MAX of 15m for standup
* "if we’re not getting things done within the timebox, try shortening the timebox"
* Rich Sheradin?
* Anybody who calls 30 or 60m meetings haven’t thought about who needs to be there and why

### User Stories
Are a unit of business value.

“As a [user-type] I want [to do xxx] so that [I get value].

The User Story gives the developers the context, the why. It serves to "bring the developers into the delighting process."

* Testable: acceptance tests
* Fit in a sprint (not an Epic as a story)
* Showing progress is powerful
* A placeholder for communication
* Product Owner <> Team

**“Product Backlog Items != User Stories”** … but includes them, and also tactical items.

### Self-organizing teams / distributed leadership
* Every Member is a leader
* Leading from your own area of expertise

### Respect and Trust
* For each other …. “yes, and”
* To act like a team, you have to practice it every day
* Blame free environments!
* Not just acknowledging but appreciating each other
* No stupid ideas
* Modelling good behavior

## Aside: Google Project Aristotle

* What makes some teams high performance, others not?
* Psychological safety! People feel comfortable talking to each other.
