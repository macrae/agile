# Agile: Executive Summary

## Overview
On November 21st, 2019, Christopher & Sean attended a workshop on Agile/Scrum in San Francisco lead by Ron Lichty (henceforth, “Ron”). This document represents our learnings from that experience and our follow-up research about how other teams in the industry are applying these tools to Data Science development. We take what we learned to make concrete proposals for how to improve our team processes, and carefully consider why we should do so.

## Why This Document?
While “Agile” is a Change Healthcare value, there is a significant difference between “doing agile” and “being agile.” In the workshop, Ron said (paraphrase):
“10 years ago, I trained people to go from waterfall to agile. In the last few years, I have been transforming teams from agile to agile.”

The Agile Manifesto has four tenets:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

We believe we have an opportunity to better embrace the Agile tenets listed above to deliver value to our customers more reliably.

In this document, we condense what we have learned as a part of this Agile/Scrum training into a digestible form. We review how other people have modified Agile & Scrum to work for Data Science, and finally make a concrete proposal for how we might adopt it to make our team more “agile.”


### Our Goals

Our goal is to improve team productivity and deliver value quickly and effectively.

#### Proposal Summary

1. Outcomes over output.

_Build the right thing. Minimize time spent building the wrong thing._

2. Product Owners provide clear prioritization and a voice for the “customer.”

_Every product team must have a single product owner who’s role it is to prioritize and value all of the possible things we could be working on._

3. Regular retrospectives for all teams to improve our process at every level.

4. Product teams should be self-organizing.

In practice, this should mean: the product team decides their development process, the definition of done, cadence, etc.


## Outcomes over Output

It's easy to think about success in terms of: how many features we ship, or how
many projects we complete, but those are just technical artifacts and metrics of the
value we produce.

They are the _outputs_, not the _outcomes_.

_Outputs_ don't tell us how valuable, if at all, the work we produce is to our customers,
but if we think about the _outcomes_ of our work, which is a change in customer behavior
that drives business results, then we reframe our understanding of of the problem space
in such a way to align with the only person that matters - the end user.

For concrete, tactical recommendations for how to think about outcomes instead of
outputs, go here: [Outcomes over Output](https://gitlab.healthcareit.net/smacrae/agile/blob/master/docs/outcomes_over_output.md).


## Product Owners: Clear Prioritization
_“When everything is a priority, nothing is a priority.”_

One primary learning from our experience at this workshop is the importance of the Product Owner. The Product Owner’s job is first and foremost to actively prioritize, given existing and new information. While each team may have more than one “product owner,” there must always be one and only one person who settles the final priority tasks.

The third radical change we should make is to have a clear product owner for every working team in the organization.


## Retro: Align on Process Through Process Improvement
There is no perfect process, and no team or human can design a process (or software!) in the first try. Therefore, as Ron says
“The most important thing is not your process, but your process for improving your process.”

In Scrum, and for us in CHC AI, this should mean regular retrospectives where the goal of the retro is to improve process and team happiness. Time for another Ron quote!
“Why don’t New Year’s Resolutions work? Because you only review them once a year.”

We don’t currently have a standardized process in the team for improving our process. If we do nothing else, we must implement this. Without an active feedback loop, we cannot improve.


## Self Organizing Teams: Happiness creates productivity
Contrary to common wisdom, research shows that happiness creates productivity, not the other way around.

Agile facilitates happiness through self-organizing teams. Self-organizing teams allow
Developers to operate in the ways they know best and maintain personal and group focus.
In turn, this helps facilitate psychological safety and developer happiness.
